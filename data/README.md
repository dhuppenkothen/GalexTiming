Data Products
=============

This directory contains files and data products useful for the analysis. 
At the moment, we are looking at X-ray binaries and magnetars. 
There are three catalogue files:

- `lmxb_cat.dat` contains the 2007 LMXB catalogue available on HEASARC (`https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/W3Browse/all/lmxbcat.html`)
- `hmxb_cat.dat` contains the corresponding catalogue of HMXBs available on HEASARC (`http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/W3Browse/star-catalog/hmxbcat.html`)
